title:  "A Worthy Endeavor"
---
What will we do with strong AI, once we have it? More effectively identify people in pictures on social networks? Read technical documents for professionals? Make even better movie recommendations? Superior autosuggest?

One worthy endeavor is the development of fabrication techniques at the nanoscale. Since the time of the first humans, manufacturing has largely been conducted top-down. We start with large aggregations of matter, and chip away until we get the desired shape and form. The resulting materials are very coarse and crude, from an atomic perspective. While we do, nowadays, have some ability to build things with atomic precision, such as small organic molecules (like drugs), our materials are generally not built with atomic specifications.

Mastering nanoscale manufacturing will be key in enabling the development of future technologies. Whether it's data storage and manipulation, or drug delivery systems, essentially all engineering problems can be aided by the incorporation of nanoscale capabilities.

AI and Machine Learning technologies can enhance our ability to work at the nanoscale. If we consider Bionanotechnology as an approach towards molecular devices, it is simply too difficult to take a combinatorial approach to finding the right protein structure that performs a given task, for example. We need rational design guided by strong and computationally efficient models. Current and future AI technologies can provide that computational power. The application of artificial intelligence to the nano world is only in its infancy, but it is certainly an exciting and worthy endeavor.
